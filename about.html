                <p>Hello! My name is Jack and I am a young web developer. After high school,
                    I attended a year of community college with the intention of persuing Information Technology. As happens to many, life got in the way and plans changed. 
                    After having several wonderful colleagues help guide me back into the field, I recently completed the MERN Full Stack Javascript program at the University of Minnesota. <br><br>
                    I am capable with both front end and back end technologies, but I have to say I favor the front end. Getting to build a fun and visually interesting user experience is very fun. I am eager to learn as many technologies as possible; React is my personal favorite so far. Tools like react bootstrap and material UI are intuitive and enjoyable to experiment with. 



                    <br><br>
                    Born and raised in the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities, I currently live in Shoreview with my wife. In my spare time, I enjoy
                    hiking, running, playing video games and reading. </p>
